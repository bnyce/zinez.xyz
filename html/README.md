## [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

### *self-replicating media*

Find any old computer that someone is getting rid of, it could be mac, pc or linux(but not Chromebook).  

You will need a thumb drive.  Follow the instructions below to install Ubuntu and wipe all the old data on the hard drive.

[https://ubuntu.com instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)

Once Ubuntu is installed, open a command line and type:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm index.html
sudo apt install curl
sudo curl -o replicator.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagicserver/main/php/replicator.txt
cd ..
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
cd html
php replicator.php
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
```
Check the IP address by hovering over the wifi icon, put that into the browser on another machine on the same local wifi network to see and edit the server.  Or open a browser on the pi and point it to [http://localhost](http://localhost).

Now to connect this pi to the outside world you want to forward port 80 traffic to your router to the pi.  To do that, look at your router and see if there is information on how to log on, including login and password and the router IP address. If you can't find that information, try looking up your router make and model in a search and trying to figure out how to log on from there. Then click around and find the port forwarding or do a search for port forwarding and your router type, and forward port 80 traffic.  

Next, you want to buy a domain name linked to a physical location near where your server is, ending in something other than .com like .net, .org, .xyz or .art.  Edit the DNS entry for your domain to have an "A record" which points to your home IP address which you can get from [www.whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/).  Contact other Trash Magic Operators with information on your server so they can link to it.

When your server is live, put files for books in "/var/www/html/media/books", zines in "/var/www/html/media/zines", and images of trash magic objects to share on the network in "/var/www/html/media/trashmagic".  Write the domain on trash and place the trash in the physical route you will walk with your cart of physical media(which could just be a bike basket or backpack).  Photograph the trash magic media which points to the domain which points to the server and put those photographs in the trashmagic folder as described above. When you make your local rounds as a Server Operator in the neighborhood, take pictures of others' trash magic along and post to the trash magic feed.

Create web pages for places, people and things on the route of the Operator.

### Replicate the Github using localhost

 - install PHP on your machine
 - create a new github repository on a CC0 PUBLIC DOMAIN license and clone it on your machine
 - copy the file [php/replicator.txt](php/replicator.txt) into a file called replicator.php in the new repo directory
 - run `php replicator.php` on your machine, wait for all the code to copy
 - push all that code up to your github repo
 - in the same directory, type `sudo php -S localhost:80`
 - go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) and you should get back to this screen, edit all elements of the system
 - use [editor.php](editor.php) to edit the file php/replicator.txt so that the two urls are the global url for *your* repo for both dna and replicator
 - after you've edited the code, click [text2php.php](text2php.php) to convert that to php
 - push your code to your github repo
 - use the new replicator code on your github repo to replicate out that instance to all other servers(linux, windows, mac, android) and forks
 - when you figure this out, make youtube videos showing other people how to copy the whole system, tell someone about those videos so that we can all link to them
